0.2778 and what is your success she shook her head
0.2692 thank youbut i always mend my own
0.2679 is this to be endured but it must not shall not be
0.2597 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out
0.2588 but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own
0.2500 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you
0.2471 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour
0.2469 my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says
0.2468 it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention
0.2462 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure
0.2449 bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down
0.2436 five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs
0.2432 who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it
0.2419 oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain
0.2394 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request
0.2394 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence
0.2394 but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out
0.2394 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require
0.2386 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness
0.2381 my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr
0.2376 darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr
0.2375 elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course
0.2375 he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security
0.2364 but my dearest love tell me what dish mr
0.2361 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary
0.2360 my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever
0.2358 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised
0.2353 be assured my dear sir that mrs
0.2344 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs
0.2344 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr
0.2333 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago
0.2333 darcy could have such boundless influence
0.2333 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever
0.2323 how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr
0.2321 darcy she could not but allow that mr
0.2321 i thought i should have broken my heart
0.2319 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr
0.2317 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south
0.2316 she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise
0.2314 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour
0.2308 but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow
0.2308 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you
0.2299 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness
0.2295 but of course she did not mention my name to you
0.2292 hurst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled
0.2288 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town
0.2286 i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr
0.2281 who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for her
0.2278 i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer
0.2276 collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance





0.2778 of course the forest surrounded all that
0.2697 this is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency
0.2500 all these were always thrown open of course
0.2410 when you have to attend to things of that sort to the mere incidents of the surface the realitythe reality i tell youfades
0.2373 but these chaps were not much account really
0.2364 but the restoh my goodness all sick
0.2364 ill carry my ideas out yeti will return
0.2364 thanks said i i shall keep my eyes open
0.2361 i sweated and shivered over that business considerably i can tell you
0.2361 the three red chaps had fallen flat face down on the shore as though they had been shot dead
0.2333 sends in as much ivory as all the others put together
0.2326 it is impossible that all this should be lostthat such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothingbut sorrow
0.2317 all that had been kurtzs had passed out of my hands his soul his body his station his plans his ivory his career
0.2273 i will never hear that chap speak after alland my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush
0.2258 i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind
0.2241 he assured me earnestly it was all right
0.2235 and now for this stupid scoundrel your success in europe is assured in any case i affirmed steadily
0.2222 a heavy and dull detonation shook the ground a puff of smoke came out of the cliff and that was all
0.2222 it seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape that the heavens would fall upon my head
0.2212 an appeal to me in this fiendish rowis there very well i hear i admit but i have a voice too and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced
0.2208 my dear aunts endeavours to nurse up my strength seemed altogether beside the mark
0.2198 deal table in the middle plain chairs all round the walls on one end a large shining map marked with all the colours of a rainbow
0.2182 but you have heard him you know she cried
0.2165 the living trees lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth might have been changed into stone even to the slenderest twig to the lightest leaf
0.2159 my intended my station my career my ideasthese were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments
0.2152 a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare
0.2135 no eloquence could have been so withering to ones belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity
0.2128 and of all this she went on mournfully of all his promise and of all his greatness of his generous mind of his noble heart nothing remainsnothing but a memory
0.2126 but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions avid of lying fame of sham distinction of all the appearances of success and power
0.2125 at this moment i heard kurtzs deep voice behind the curtain save mesave the ivory you mean
0.2125 incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been essentially a great musician
0.2121 what another snag a fusillade burst out under my feet
0.2118 he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through
0.2115 it had known the ships and the men
0.2105 he is an emissary of pity and science and progress and devil knows what else
0.2105 or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds
0.2097 well i havent been there yet and shall not try now
0.2090 he noticed my companion and became crestfallen all at once
0.2083 they were called criminals and the outraged law like the bursting shells had come to them an insoluble mystery from the sea
0.2073 redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution
0.2069 oh quite i had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten the fishes alone should have him
0.2062 i saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride of ruthless power of craven terrorof an intense and hopeless despair
0.2056 it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze
0.2054 i kept my head pretty well but when i had him at last stretched on the couch i wiped my forehead while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my back down that hill
0.2051 and this also said marlow suddenly has been one of the dark places of the earth
0.2048 pardon my questions but you are the first englishman coming under my observation
0.2048 being alone in the wilderness it had looked within itself and by heavens i tell you it had gone mad
0.2048 and the girl talked easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy she talked as thirsty men drink
0.2045 it was then well on in the afternoon the face of the forest was gloomy and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water
0.2041 he must have been shouting





1.0000 but success shall crown my endeavours
0.2857 he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it
0.2800 you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes
0.2791 he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain
0.2700 here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress
0.2615 she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget
0.2614 but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue
0.2609 in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors
0.2581 all was again silent but his words rang in my ears
0.2574 surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance
0.2561 when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation
0.2558 i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime
0.2551 that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession
0.2532 it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother
0.2500 heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness
0.2500 be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger
0.2500 i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow
0.2477 it was from my own elizabeth my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account
0.2473 this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken i know the murderer
0.2442 i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer
0.2421 but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond
0.2404 i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures
0.2400 i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alone
0.2400 but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone
0.2400 but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die
0.2396 this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m
0.2396 she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her
0.2394 six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking
0.2391 i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel
0.2371 she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety
0.2366 but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man
0.2358 we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity
0.2353 but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william
0.2353 listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve
0.2346 she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody
0.2326 in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly
0.2326 this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not
0.2323 i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes
0.2316 i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town
0.2308 thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual
0.2308 i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion
0.2301 when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me
0.2295 but she will be tried today and you will then hear all
0.2289 slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension
0.2289 i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair
0.2286 she is innocent my elizabeth said i and that shall be proved fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal
0.2283 excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own
0.2278 chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment
0.2273 i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval
0.2273 how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting





0.2542 they all can said the duchess and most of em do
0.2308 but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes
0.2294 poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
0.2268 if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does
0.2245 if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think
0.2222 then the dormouse shall they both cried
0.2209 how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once
0.2200 write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
0.2192 but youre so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply
0.2192 if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king
0.2188 they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood
0.2177 silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
0.2162 its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it
0.2160 back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice
0.2150 there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again
0.2143 well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air
0.2143 we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do
0.2121 they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs
0.2105 then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered
0.2099 and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject
0.2095 the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk come we shall have some fun now thought alice
0.2083 if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose
0.2083 so they got thrown out to sea
0.2078 who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time
0.2075 her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
0.2073 would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud
0.2073 redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution
0.2069 i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm
0.2066 nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited
0.2065 dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
0.2055 its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue
0.2055 youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
0.2051 youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea
0.2049 and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
0.2043 when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all
0.2029 is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could
0.2028 alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited
0.2024 and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness
0.2021 can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her
0.2020 i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer today
0.2020 i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it
0.2017 two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
0.2017 ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
0.2015 you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
0.2000 alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window
0.2000 alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
0.2000 and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours
0.2000 just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
0.2000 i mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer
0.2000 give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot





0.2899 this bunburying as you call it has not been a great success for you
0.2740 but my dear lady bracknell the matter is entirely in your own hands
0.2609 my letters but my own sweet cecily i have never written you any letters

0.2233 i have a country house with some land of course attached to it about fifteen hundred acres i believe but i dont depend on that for my real income
0.2222 these delightful records should have been my constant study

0.2203 shall i lay tea here as usual miss cecily
0.2202 cecily cecily surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather moultons duty than yours especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you

0.2182 yes but its hereditary my dear fellow

0.2152 my duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree
0.2143 i may tell you candidly that the place is not in shropshire
0.2143 i say its perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under the circumstances

0.2909 i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister
0.2778 i shall be there but only as one of the crowd
0.2656 cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence
0.2647 several doors were opened in succession and finally his own
0.2644 to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth and beauty was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd
0.2547 an hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to will render me less worth such tears as those than any wretch who creeps along the streets
0.2545 how do they call that man he is english

0.2394 consider how natural and how plain it is my dear that it should be so
0.2391 it was the alwaysvain endeavour to discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my fatal presence near you
0.2371 but by this time she trembled under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety and above all such dread and terror that mr

0.2273 touch then they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones
0.2268 in this state they traversed without change except of horses and pace all the miredeep leagues that lay between them and the capital
0.2268 she only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered
0.2267 as i serve my gun that day i resolve when the place shall fall to examine that cell

0.2209 the way out of court lay in that direction and jerry followed him all eyes ears and spikes
0.2209 charles evremonde called darnay in right of such proscription absolutely dead in law

0.2195 he had known the last witness seven or eight years that was merely a coincidence
0.2195 we have been so full of business all day that we have not known what to do first or which way to turn
0.2195 and it was such vapouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so
0.2190 taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly reminded of that expression
0.2188 from that time in all weathers she waited there two hours
0.2188 devoutly thankful to heaven for his recovered selfpossession he thought there is but another now and turned to walk again
0.2185 cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time
0.2177 but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he had relinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with no favour in it won his own private place there and earned his own bread

0.2178 i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes stick your head down lowerthere thatll do you cant be seen now
0.2174 but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way
0.2165 well then whatll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood

0.2133 i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his back but on his face
0.2133 i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again

0.2125 i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe
0.2121 when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo
0.2121 nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me
0.2118 she was tore up a good dealone en of her was but dey warnt no great harm done ony our traps was mos all los
0.2113 now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place





0.2909 she will be my successor in this house
0.2676 but never mind about that the chief thing is she had made a successshe had made a tremendous success
0.2658 look here is the dress torvald had it made for me there but now it is all so torn and i havent any idea mrs
0.2656 but my dear nora you have just told me all your troubles
0.2597 krogstadyou one of my husbands subordinates but since you ask you shall know
0.2549 have you really the courage then mrs
0.2500 but let me tell you thisif i lose my position a second time you shall lose yours with me
0.2500 now you have destroyed all my happiness
0.2464 really and is it absolutely necessary that it should be here mrs
0.2429 when helmer has had my letter i shall expect a message from him
0.2407 in what way you shall have your money soon
0.2405 no torvald has not had an hours illness since then and our children are strong and healthy and so am i
0.2366 just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa and how horribly they slandered him
0.2353 my dear i have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer
0.2353 well at all events you know now that you can command me body and soul
0.2353 you shall not suffer for my sake
0.2344 but there is one thing i can do in any case and i shall do it at once
0.2321 tomorrow i shall go homei mean to my old home
0.2308 if i should go out of my mindand it might easily happen mrs
0.2300 as soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come i shall send you my card with a black cross on it and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun
0.2255 but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know my goodness cant you understand that it was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in
0.2254 yes but nurse i shall not be able to be so much with them now as i was before
0.2250 linde shall have
0.2222 but i can assure you that my one false step which lost me all my reputation was nothing more or nothing worse than what you have done
0.2222 i will tell you whati shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers
0.2222 besides what use would it be i should have him completely in my power all the same
0.2222 all my life as long as i can remember i have worked and it has been my greatest and only pleasure
0.2212 but what would my assurances have been worth against yours that was the wonderful thing which i hoped for and feared and it was to prevent that that i wanted to kill myself
0.2203 she goes out hurriedly through the hall door
0.2200 i shall only make one more examination of myself when i have done that i shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin
0.2195 but twentyfour hours have elapsed since then and in that time i have witnessed incredible things in this house
0.2192 if you speak slightingly of my husband i shall turn you out of the house
0.2192 but my dearest nora how do you know anything about such things nora walking about
0.2192 is that what it all meansthat you want to save your friend at any cost tell me frankly
0.2188 it was near but then you came and stood in my way
0.2188 why shouldnt i look at my dearest treasureat all the beauty that is mine all my very own nora going to the other side of the table
0.2179 well i had to turn my hand to anything i could findfirst a small shop then a small school and so on
0.2167 i shall only preserve itkeep it in my possession
0.2162 so it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life poor nora nora
0.2162 it is something out of all reason it means advice and help and a favour rank
0.2152 come what will you may be sure i shall have both courage and strength if they be needed
0.2131 i thought i was but it has never really been so
0.2128 she does not seem to hear him her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders she pays no attention to it but goes on dancing
0.2115 you have ruined all my future
0.2111 far from it my dear fellow it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness i was telling you of
0.2105 yes we have known each other since then
0.2105 if my husband does get to know of it of course he will at once pay you what is still owing and we shall have nothing more to do with you
0.2105 nurse i want you to tell me something i have often wondered abouthow could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers nurse
0.2105 but surely you can understand that being with torvald is a little like being with papaenter maid from the hall
0.2105 as i had to break with you it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me





0.2951 we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
0.2895 it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn
0.2857 he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner
0.2842 i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes
0.2833 in that case i shall continue my professional round
0.2727 he shall find me ready when he comes back
0.2667 they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand
0.2656 there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones
0.2625 i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning
0.2625 i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me
0.2604 wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
0.2576 you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men
0.2556 the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes
0.2545 but you shall have it all just as it occurred
0.2540 i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police
0.2532 about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
0.2500 your hands my dear sir
0.2500 then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out
0.2500 but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful
0.2500 but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room
0.2479 now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success
0.2462 holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
0.2456 now i have told you all my adventures mr
0.2449 but have you told me all yes all
0.2444 he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke
0.2442 i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown
0.2424 it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it
0.2419 oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part
0.2419 an enemy yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey
0.2414 but it might have been a cry of surprise
0.2400 and how have you succeeded well
0.2400 i shall have the others but he first
0.2394 mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was
0.2394 well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake
0.2394 but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once
0.2394 now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
0.2391 of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh
0.2388 i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london
0.2386 i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime
0.2381 i have myself some small business matters to attend to
0.2381 your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it
0.2376 mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground
0.2375 i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart
0.2373 ah said he carelessly we have our own process
0.2368 it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have pounds at once
0.2360 merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london
0.2353 i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those
0.2353 all has turned out splendidly
0.2347 during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me
0.2344 i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now





0.2540 but then each from his own side they hurried out of bed
0.2258 if he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it
0.2258 this meant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room in this establishment in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen
0.2213 this meant that his mothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch
0.2211 and she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements
0.2143 across the room despite the chilly weather gregors mother had pulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face
0.2135 it nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening
0.2095 and the chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state
0.2073 redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution
0.2072 gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance
0.2069 she still cleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have been any quicker about it
0.2041 thats all been sorted out
0.2033 gregor made a run for him he wanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have expected something as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase
0.2021 thats to say it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies money to live on had to be earned
0.2016 hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing
0.2000 first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five
0.2000 he could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things
0.2000 gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of course but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual
0.2000 when she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention
0.1985 for the days that i have been living here i will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary i will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action
0.1980 but now of course he had far better control of his body than before and even with a fall as great as that caused himself no damage
0.1979 the door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below
0.1972 unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg
0.1957 she answered him with subdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest mothers fainted but shes better now
0.1951 it was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour tearfully thanking gregors mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service
0.1947 during the five years that he had not been working the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy
0.1940 what shall we take now then said grete and looked around
0.1933 you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenbergtm works
0.1932 as she approached the room gregor could hear his mother express her joy but once at the door she went silent
0.1928 it was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebody in the flat
0.1927 gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat and receive no more answer than no thanks ive had enough or something similar
0.1927 if she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for gregor to cut himself off so completely
0.1923 as soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead
0.1915 the first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast
0.1915 he probably did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high
0.1912 would his sister have to go and earn money she was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting of wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin
0.1905 but what now if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end that was something that gregor did not want to think about too much so he started to move about crawling up and down the room
0.1900 as nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room
0.1899 it was not a lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated
0.1890 milk like this was normally his favourite drink and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that but he turned almost against his own will away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room
0.1890 she soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes wide whistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms come and ave a look at this its dead just lying there stone dead mr
0.1881 but he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him
0.1880 i had originally intended to say all this to you in private but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason i dont see why your parents should not also learn of it
0.1880 volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need is critical to reaching project gutenbergtms goals and ensuring that the project gutenbergtm collection will remain freely available for generations to come
0.1863 before he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others
0.1860 we wouldnt have a brother any more then but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect
0.1852 i dont want to call this monster my brother all i can say is we have to try and get rid of it
0.1845 it was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward in a panic
0.1845 if gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it but as it was it caused him pain
0.1845 in this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly
