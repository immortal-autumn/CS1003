0.2632 and what is your success she shook her head
0.2376 bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down
0.2321 thank youbut i always mend my own
0.2308 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness
0.2297 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence
0.2289 elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course
0.2247 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour
0.2237 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you
0.2222 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness
0.2222 darcy could have such boundless influence
0.2222 but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own
0.2222 it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention
0.2222 be assured my dear sir that mrs
0.2203 i thought i should have broken my heart
0.2195 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out
0.2195 five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs
0.2190 darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr
0.2174 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure
0.2174 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in
0.2160 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour
0.2159 my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr
0.2143 the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you
0.2136 how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr
0.2133 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request
0.2133 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require
0.2131 is this to be endured but it must not shall not be
0.2128 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever
0.2121 oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain
0.2119 who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for her
0.2105 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary
0.2105 with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success
0.2101 hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party
0.2100 hurst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled
0.2100 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it
0.2093 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south
0.2093 my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says
0.2083 chapter my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table
0.2072 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised
0.2063 your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings
0.2063 you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us
0.2059 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs
0.2059 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own
0.2059 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr
0.2055 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr
0.2048 i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer
0.2041 as they went downstairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza
0.2041 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention
0.2039 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference
0.2039 many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i despair
0.2033 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town





0.2473 this is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency
0.2414 of course the forest surrounded all that
0.2267 the three red chaps had fallen flat face down on the shore as though they had been shot dead
0.2184 when you have to attend to things of that sort to the mere incidents of the surface the realitythe reality i tell youfades
0.2167 all these were always thrown open of course
0.2125 my dear aunts endeavours to nurse up my strength seemed altogether beside the mark
0.2093 all that had been kurtzs had passed out of my hands his soul his body his station his plans his ivory his career
0.2063 but these chaps were not much account really
0.2048 at this moment i heard kurtzs deep voice behind the curtain save mesave the ivory you mean
0.2048 incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been essentially a great musician
0.2034 ill carry my ideas out yeti will return
0.2034 thanks said i i shall keep my eyes open
0.2031 sends in as much ivory as all the others put together
0.2022 and now for this stupid scoundrel your success in europe is assured in any case i affirmed steadily
0.2000 it had known the ships and the men
0.2000 deal table in the middle plain chairs all round the walls on one end a large shining map marked with all the colours of a rainbow
0.2000 a heavy and dull detonation shook the ground a puff of smoke came out of the cliff and that was all
0.2000 i will never hear that chap speak after alland my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush
0.2000 oh quite i had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten the fishes alone should have him
0.2000 it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze
0.2000 i saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride of ruthless power of craven terrorof an intense and hopeless despair
0.2000 it seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape that the heavens would fall upon my head
0.1980 the living trees lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth might have been changed into stone even to the slenderest twig to the lightest leaf
0.1978 it is impossible that all this should be lostthat such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothingbut sorrow
0.1975 and this also said marlow suddenly has been one of the dark places of the earth
0.1970 i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind
0.1963 we could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil
0.1963 i put down the glass and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance
0.1959 its really easier to face bereavement dishonour and the perdition of ones soulthan this kind of prolonged hunger
0.1957 my intended my station my career my ideasthese were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments
0.1948 i sweated and shivered over that business considerably i can tell you
0.1944 it was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes
0.1939 while i stood horrorstruck one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees and went off on allfours towards the river to drink
0.1935 he assured me earnestly it was all right
0.1928 a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare
0.1927 an appeal to me in this fiendish rowis there very well i hear i admit but i have a voice too and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced
0.1923 he must have been shouting
0.1919 or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds
0.1919 this fair hair this pale visage this pure brow seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me
0.1910 i always ask leave in the interests of science to measure the crania of those going out there he said
0.1910 he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through
0.1900 they were called criminals and the outraged law like the bursting shells had come to them an insoluble mystery from the sea
0.1894 but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions avid of lying fame of sham distinction of all the appearances of success and power
0.1884 the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap
0.1882 i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end and to show my loyalty to kurtz once more
0.1875 they were conquerors and for that you want only brute forcenothing to boast of when you have it since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others
0.1875 suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet
0.1875 he is an emissary of pity and science and progress and devil knows what else
0.1875 and you say absurd absurd beexploded absurd my dear boys what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes now i think of it it is amazing i did not shed tears
0.1875 not alone surely he muttered something about the villages round that lake





0.8250 but success shall crown my endeavours
0.2632 he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it
0.2556 he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain
0.2500 she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget
0.2500 here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress
0.2439 it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother
0.2396 in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors
0.2391 but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue
0.2381 surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance
0.2375 you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes
0.2360 i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer
0.2353 that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession
0.2316 i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel
0.2301 it was from my own elizabeth my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account
0.2300 i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow
0.2297 six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking
0.2294 we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity
0.2292 heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness
0.2262 be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger
0.2247 in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly
0.2245 i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town
0.2234 i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion
0.2222 i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures
0.2212 i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alone
0.2200 she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her
0.2200 my daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured
0.2198 i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime
0.2195 chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment
0.2188 i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor
0.2188 i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth
0.2184 when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation
0.2182 at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness
0.2165 i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking
0.2159 i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly
0.2159 you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature
0.2143 this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken i know the murderer
0.2137 when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me
0.2136 i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes
0.2135 listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve
0.2133 my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events
0.2132 how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting
0.2130 thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual
0.2118 she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody
0.2111 this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not
0.2105 i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval
0.2101 clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving new from my friends
0.2100 after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began
0.2100 but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond
0.2095 but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die
0.2090 my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew





0.2222 they all can said the duchess and most of em do
0.2124 poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
0.2078 its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it
0.2073 but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes
0.2059 if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think
0.2031 silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
0.2024 and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject
0.2020 if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose
0.2019 write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
0.2016 back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice
0.2000 how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once
0.1974 youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
0.1961 if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does
0.1961 so they got thrown out to sea
0.1959 can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her
0.1954 and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness
0.1949 then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered
0.1948 but youre so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply
0.1948 if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king
0.1935 i mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer
0.1932 we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do
0.1920 nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited
0.1908 well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air
0.1905 and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
0.1897 then the dormouse shall they both cried
0.1881 they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood
0.1875 there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again
0.1875 i believe i can guess that she added aloud
0.1875 dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
0.1870 two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
0.1870 ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
0.1868 i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm
0.1860 would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud
0.1857 they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs
0.1856 when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all
0.1852 who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time
0.1845 i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer today
0.1845 i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it
0.1842 alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
0.1840 well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice
0.1829 youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea
0.1824 alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited
0.1818 its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue
0.1818 oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror
0.1818 the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk come we shall have some fun now thought alice
0.1810 first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there
0.1807 i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room
0.1802 her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
0.1799 you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
0.1798 give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot





0.2459 my dear fellow gwendolen is my first cousin
0.2432 this bunburying as you call it has not been a great success for you
0.2419 ernest has been suddenly called back to town
0.2329 my letters but my own sweet cecily i have never written you any letters
0.2308 but my dear lady bracknell the matter is entirely in your own hands
0.2245 i feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men although i have the same list as the dear duchess of bolton has
0.2241 i think it has been a great success
0.2203 your town address at the albany i have
0.2174 of course i admit that the faults were all on my side
0.2135 i never had a brother in my life and i certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future
0.2099 you can put up my dress clothes my smoking jacket and all the bunbury suits
0.2093 i have known several jacks and they all without exception were more than usually plain
0.2083 more than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldnt read
0.2075 algernon crosses and hands tea
0.2073 my duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree
0.2051 divorces are made in heavenjack puts out his hand to take a sandwich
0.2045 do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time i wish to goodness you had let me know
0.2037 i mean it naturally is ernest
0.2035 cecily cecily surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather moultons duty than yours especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you
0.2029 bunbury die his death must have been extremely sudden
0.1977 but you dont really mean to say that you couldnt love me if my name wasnt ernest gwendolen
0.1974 these delightful records should have been my constant study
0.1951 a case of twins that occurred recently in one of the outlying cottages on your own estate
0.1944 how are you my dear ernest what brings you up to town jack
0.1944 i have a country house with some land of course attached to it about fifteen hundred acres i believe but i dont depend on that for my real income
0.1944 from the expression on mammas face i fear we never shall
0.1944 memory my dear cecily is the diary that we all carry about with us
0.1944 good heavens i suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own garden
0.1935 i suspected that my dear fellow i have bunburyed all over shropshire on two separate occasions
0.1932 your vanity is ridiculous your conduct an outrage and your presence in my garden utterly absurd
0.1932 i say its perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under the circumstances
0.1930 thats all that can be said about land
0.1918 i mean of course you are continually christening arent you miss prism
0.1915 about my what cecily
0.1915 ernest my own ernest jack
0.1915 to dear little cecily of course not what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head gwendolen
0.1912 that my dear algy is the whole truth pure and simple
0.1912 literary criticism is not your forte my dear fellow
0.1912 when i am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me
0.1905 shall i lay tea here as usual miss cecily
0.1899 indeed he always lays stress on your german when he is leaving for town
0.1892 i may tell you candidly that the place is not in shropshire
0.1892 do you allude to me miss cardew as an entanglement you are presumptuous
0.1887 as a man sows so shall he reap
0.1884 you are absurdly careless about sending out invitations
0.1875 if the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise i shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once and with a firm hand
0.1875 algy you young scoundrel you will have to treat me with more respect in the future
0.1875 ernest my own ernest i felt from the first that you could have no other name jack
0.1864 yes but its hereditary my dear fellow
0.1860 of course not what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head cecily





0.2542 i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister
0.2537 cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence
0.2418 to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth and beauty was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd
0.2361 several doors were opened in succession and finally his own
0.2333 tut nonsense sirand my dear charles said mr
0.2252 an hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to will render me less worth such tears as those than any wretch who creeps along the streets
0.2211 i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
0.2203 how do they call that man he is english
0.2203 i shall be there but only as one of the crowd
0.2192 being made right by you in that dress i shall have no fear
0.2188 it was the alwaysvain endeavour to discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my fatal presence near you
0.2184 before shrewsbury and at shrewsbury and ever since shrewsbury pursued carton you have fallen into your rank and i have fallen into mine
0.2174 touch then they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones
0.2167 why need i speak of my fathers time when it is equally yours can i separate my fathers twinbrother joint inheritor and next successor from himself death has done that said the marquis
0.2165 quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage
0.2154 really is bad enough returned miss pross but better
0.2137 france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it
0.2135 charles evremonde called darnay in right of such proscription absolutely dead in law
0.2133 consider how natural and how plain it is my dear that it should be so
0.2130 taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly reminded of that expression

0.2118 he had known the last witness seven or eight years that was merely a coincidence
0.2105 when i speak of success i speak of success with the young lady and when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable i speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady

0.2083 so sunken and suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground

0.2066 so expressive it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die
0.2059 but by this time she trembled under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety and above all such dread and terror that mr
0.2055 we know now what you underwent when you suspected my descent and when you knew it
0.2048 lorrys at nine shall i hear what you have done either from our friend or from yourself yes
0.2047 and it was such vapouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so
0.2041 my dear charles said mr
0.2033 cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time

0.2027 nor is that all my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground

0.2000 nevertheless pursued darnay rising to ring the bell there is nothing in that i hope to prevent my calling the reckoning and our parting without illblood on either side
0.2000 under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the court followed out into the streets





0.2388 you all hearn me hes crazy si everything shows it si

0.2083 then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business
0.2079 en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot is so thankful

0.2063 this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots decd and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened twas not from sickness shots
0.2051 i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again
0.2051 all right then ill do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs
0.2048 providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now
0.2045 you float along down about twenty miles and youll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river
0.2039 some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave
0.2025 theyve got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides
0.2024 i haint been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you
0.2021 yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then well hitch up and take you down to nicholss
0.2021 i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance
0.2000 ole missusdats miss watsonshe pecks on me all de time en treats me pooty rough but she awluz said she wouldn sell me down to orleans
0.2000 i owns mysef en is wuth eight hundd dollars
0.2000 never mind buck my boy says the old man youll have show enough all in good time dont you fret about that
0.2000 the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
0.1982 i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding
0.1979 but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way
0.1978 but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans
0.1974 you mean to say our old raft warnt smashed all to flinders no she warnt
0.1951 then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season
0.1951 the dukes room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby
0.1948 so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short
0.1942 when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo
0.1930 so out he went and down cellar went i
0.1926 folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild
0.1923 but weve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances
0.1923 i crope out all atremblin en crope aroun en open de do easy en slow en poke my head in behine de chile sof en still en all uv a sudden i says pow jis as loud as i could yell
0.1915 now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
0.1915 it was about sundown
0.1913 we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybody running across us
0.1912 and besides a body couldnt breathe and hear such talk
0.1910 so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it
0.1905 i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe
0.1905 one er dem big cattaillookin mullenstalks would grow in heah mars tom i reckn but she wouldnt be wuth half de trouble shed coss
0.1899 away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits
0.1899 my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun
0.1897 he had his own by him but i handed him mine
0.1895 when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff sure enough i could just barely see her
0.1895 all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on
0.1892 so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar





0.2542 she will be my successor in this house
0.2407 have you really the courage then mrs
0.2400 but never mind about that the chief thing is she had made a successshe had made a tremendous success
0.2361 really and is it absolutely necessary that it should be here mrs
0.2317 no torvald has not had an hours illness since then and our children are strong and healthy and so am i
0.2262 look here is the dress torvald had it made for me there but now it is all so torn and i havent any idea mrs
0.2254 my dear i have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer
0.2206 if i should go out of my mindand it might easily happen mrs
0.2195 krogstadyou one of my husbands subordinates but since you ask you shall know
0.2174 but my dear nora you have just told me all your troubles
0.2167 now you have destroyed all my happiness
0.2165 just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa and how horribly they slandered him
0.2162 when helmer has had my letter i shall expect a message from him
0.2115 as soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come i shall send you my card with a black cross on it and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun
0.2083 well at all events you know now that you can command me body and soul
0.2078 but let me tell you thisif i lose my position a second time you shall lose yours with me
0.2075 but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know my goodness cant you understand that it was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in
0.2069 in what way you shall have your money soon
0.2043 far from it my dear fellow it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness i was telling you of
0.2019 i shall only make one more examination of myself when i have done that i shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin
0.2000 yes we have known each other since then
0.2000 besides what use would it be i should have him completely in my power all the same
0.2000 all my life as long as i can remember i have worked and it has been my greatest and only pleasure
0.2000 why shouldnt i look at my dearest treasureat all the beauty that is mine all my very own nora going to the other side of the table
0.2000 yes my dear friend i have quite made up my mind about that
0.2000 you shall not suffer for my sake
0.2000 tomorrow i shall go homei mean to my old home
0.1977 but twentyfour hours have elapsed since then and in that time i have witnessed incredible things in this house
0.1974 i will tell you whati shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers
0.1970 then she springs to the front of the stage and calls out
0.1961 she goes out through the hall
0.1951 you havent any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have torvald
0.1951 well i had to turn my hand to anything i could findfirst a small shop then a small school and so on
0.1948 if you speak slightingly of my husband i shall turn you out of the house
0.1948 but my dearest nora how do you know anything about such things nora walking about
0.1948 is that what it all meansthat you want to save your friend at any cost tell me frankly
0.1944 that was the saddest time i have known since our marriage
0.1940 and that is as it should be my own darling nora
0.1939 she does not seem to hear him her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders she pays no attention to it but goes on dancing
0.1932 it really is soof course it is sits down in the rockingchair and looks at him with a smile
0.1930 yes christine is it really you mrs
0.1930 he bows and goes out through the hall
0.1928 come what will you may be sure i shall have both courage and strength if they be needed
0.1927 but what would my assurances have been worth against yours that was the wonderful thing which i hoped for and feared and it was to prevent that that i wanted to kill myself
0.1923 so it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life poor nora nora
0.1923 it is something out of all reason it means advice and help and a favour rank
0.1919 if my husband does get to know of it of course he will at once pay you what is still owing and we shall have nothing more to do with you
0.1919 nurse i want you to tell me something i have often wondered abouthow could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers nurse
0.1919 but surely you can understand that being with torvald is a little like being with papaenter maid from the hall
0.1912 it was near but then you came and stood in my way





0.2625 it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn
0.2615 we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
0.2540 they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand
0.2500 in that case i shall continue my professional round
0.2500 i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes
0.2464 you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men
0.2400 wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
0.2400 he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner
0.2381 i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning
0.2373 he shall find me ready when he comes back
0.2360 i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown
0.2340 the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes
0.2340 your hands my dear sir
0.2289 about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
0.2273 but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful
0.2264 and how have you succeeded well
0.2258 ah said he carelessly we have our own process
0.2239 i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police
0.2237 you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
0.2235 i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me
0.2234 he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke
0.2222 now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success
0.2211 think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser
0.2206 then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out
0.2190 mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground
0.2174 there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones
0.2174 i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime
0.2174 holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
0.2162 simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful
0.2157 during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me
0.2143 it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do
0.2143 i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart
0.2143 hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also
0.2136 it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
0.2133 on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful
0.2133 mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was
0.2131 i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense
0.2131 now i have told you all my adventures mr
0.2128 this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject
0.2125 it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have pounds at once
0.2121 oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part
0.2121 an enemy yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey
0.2115 it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it
0.2113 i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london
0.2111 a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury
0.2111 you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
0.2111 i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual
0.2100 and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli i really have made no inquiries on the subject
0.2099 i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face
0.2097 but it might have been a cry of surprise





0.2239 but then each from his own side they hurried out of bed
0.2188 if he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it
0.2079 across the room despite the chilly weather gregors mother had pulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face
0.2062 this meant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room in this establishment in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen
0.2020 and she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements
0.2018 gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance
0.1969 this meant that his mothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch
0.1935 it nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening
0.1927 and the chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state
0.1890 gregor made a run for him he wanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have expected something as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase
0.1875 gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat and receive no more answer than no thanks ive had enough or something similar
0.1860 he could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things
0.1855 when she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention
0.1852 for the days that i have been living here i will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary i will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action
0.1852 as soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead
0.1845 as nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room
0.1837 thats to say it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies money to live on had to be earned
0.1800 the door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below
0.1795 during the five years that he had not been working the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy
0.1793 father look just look she suddenly screamed hes starting again in her alarm which was totally beyond gregors comprehension his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near gregor
0.1789 you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenbergtm works
0.1783 hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing
0.1774 under his sisters experienced hand the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room
0.1771 she answered him with subdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest mothers fainted but shes better now
0.1770 if she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for gregor to cut himself off so completely
0.1757 first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five
0.1756 she soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes wide whistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms come and ave a look at this its dead just lying there stone dead mr
0.1752 volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need is critical to reaching project gutenbergtms goals and ensuring that the project gutenbergtm collection will remain freely available for generations to come
0.1739 gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of course but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual
0.1739 as she approached the room gregor could hear his mother express her joy but once at the door she went silent
0.1739 she still cleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have been any quicker about it
0.1735 the first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast
0.1735 he probably did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high
0.1733 unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg
0.1724 it was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebody in the flat
0.1724 samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is how they went into gregors room
0.1724 redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution
0.1720 there was seldom any conversation especially at first that was not about him in some way even if only in secret
0.1719 it was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour tearfully thanking gregors mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service
0.1714 but he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him
0.1711 he was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment and he waited
0.1705 they had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them
0.1702 would his sister have to go and earn money she was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting of wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin
0.1698 but now of course he had far better control of his body than before and even with a fall as great as that caused himself no damage
0.1698 before he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others
0.1698 thats all been sorted out
0.1690 what shall we take now then said grete and looked around
0.1687 it was not a lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated
0.1684 had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been it certainly must have rung
0.1682 it was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward in a panic
